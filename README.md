# Vision 
The Employee Time-Off Administration System will replace the current paper-based time-off approval system with a software-based approach, increasing efficiency and reducing costs and paper usage.
# Project Overview
## The Problem
The XYZ Company is a fictitious company that uses a paper-based system to track employee time-off requests for its 65+ full-time employees. Employees wishing to take personal or vacation days must print, complete, and submit a form downloaded from the company’s internal website.  They must also submit a form after the fact when missing days for illness or emergencies.  Sometimes, the employee’s supervisor must create and submit a form on the employee’s behalf.
After receiving the request, the employee’s supervisor reviews the form and either approves or denies it.  If approved, the request is forwarded to the CEO's office.  The CEO reviews the request and either approves or denies it.  If the request is approved, the CEO’s executive assistant enters the request into a password-protected Excel spreadsheet.  
The spreadsheet contains a tab for each employee, detailing the time-off history segmented by calendar year starting from the employee’s hire date.  Each year contains formulas to calculate the number of days taken and remaining as paid time off (PTO) and vacation.
Depending upon the nature of the request, the supervisor or the CEO’s office may request additional information, usually requests that fall under the Family/Medical Leave Act.  
Lastly, the approved leave form is forwarded to the HR department.  An employee might receive approval for time-off even when they have no PTO or vacation time to cover the request. In this instance, the payroll department adjusts the employee’s paycheck for the approved unpaid time off.
The current system has several inefficiencies and weaknesses that a software-based solution can solve:
*	Employees must download the form from the company’s website, and then print, complete, and submit it.
*	Time-off requests are sometimes lost or delayed as they travel between the employee, supervisor, and the CEO’s office.
*	Employees must request a statement from the Executive Assistant of the number of days taken and remaining for the calendar year.
## Proposed Solution
Heering, Pevytoe, and Thompson (**HPT**) recommend replacing the current paper-based system with a software-based solution, either a desktop, mobile, or web browser application.  We recommend starting with a web browser application, and depending on the company’s needs, adding a desktop and/or mobile version.  The web browser version could be hosted on a cloud service or the company’s internal server. It will provide the following benefits:
*	Efficient routing of requests between the employee, supervisor, and the CEO’s office.
*	Automated notifications when the status of time-off requests changes.
*	Automated notifications to HR and Payroll Departments for FMSA and unpaid absences.
*	Reduced paper costs
*	Employees will have on-demand access to their individual time-off and attendance records
*	Supervisors will have on-demand access to time-off and attendance records for their subordinates
*	CEO’s office is relieved of the responsibility to provide information to employees
